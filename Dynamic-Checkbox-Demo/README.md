# Dynamic Checkbox Demo
 A demo application about using JS-CSPro API (https://www.csprousers.org/help/CSPro/javascript_interface.html) to display dynamic checkbox based on list and array.
 Until Version 7.7, the only way to have checkbox in a CSPro application was to have items in the dictionary. This prevented application developers 
 to implement dynamic checkboxes. 
 
This demo give us a great way to have a more dynamic "on the fly" checkboxes. Thanks to Gregory H Martin for providing CSProusers support for a better 
understanding of HTML Dialogs inputs (https://www.csprousers.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5313).
This demo app is implementing a small lib to simplify this task.
It based on the following two functions:
1) SelectJson with three arguments:
a) A string: titleName who will display the heading text for the checkbox dialog;
b) A list string: headerCaption who have two items for displaying text for column heading;
c) A two dimensions string array: data who have data/items who'll be selected;
This function will output a Json string following the same logic of the one that Gregory H Marting posted for displaying checkboxes with htmlDialog.

2) extractNumeric with a string argument: alphanumeric This function will parse the result of the htmlDialog (in the demo: showCsproValueInSelect function) and extract a list of numeric indexes;

TO DO:
i) Use the result of extractNumeric and loop it in with the array used as the argument of SelectJson and having the final string.
ii) Cleaning the logic. In the actual logic there's a double loop. However, I'm using only one. It's because I was seeking a way to use a single 
argument name for whatever array or using an Hashmap.
